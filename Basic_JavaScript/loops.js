/* You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.
The first type of loop is called a while loop because it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.*/

// Add the numbers 5 through 0 (inclusive) in descending order to myArray using a while loop.

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 5;
while(i>=0){
    myArray.push(i);
    i--;
}
