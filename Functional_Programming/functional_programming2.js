/*The slice method returns a copy of certain elements of an array. 
It can take two arguments, the first gives the index of where to begin the slice, the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it's non-inclusive). 
If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning of the array through the end, which is an easy way to make a copy of the entire array. 
The slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one.

Here's an example:

var arr = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra"];
var newArray = arr.slice(1, 3);

newArray would have the value ["Dog", "Tiger"]. */

//Use the slice method in the sliceArray function to return part of the anim array given the provided beginSlice and endSlice indices. The function should return an array.

function sliceArray(anim, beginSlice, endSlice) {
    return anim.slice(beginSlice, endSlice);
  }
  var inputAnim = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra", "Ant"];
  sliceArray(inputAnim, 1, 3);

/*A common pattern while working with arrays is when you want to remove items and keep the rest of the array. 
JavaScript offers the splice method for this, which takes arguments for the index of where to start removing items, then the number of items to remove. 
If the second argument is not provided, the default is to remove items through the end.
However, the splice method mutates the original array it is called on. Here's an example:

var cities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];
cities.splice(3, 1);

Here splice returns the string London and deletes it from the cities array. cities will have the value ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "Berlin"].

As we saw in the last challenge, the slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one which can be saved into a variable. 
Recall that the slice method takes two arguments for the indices to begin and end the slice (the end is non-inclusive), and returns those items in a new array. 
Using the slice method instead of splice helps to avoid any array-mutating side effects.*/

/*Rewrite the function nonMutatingSplice by using slice instead of splice. 
It should limit the provided cities array to a length of 3, and return a new array with only the first three items.

Do not mutate the original array provided to the function.*/

function nonMutatingSplice(cities) {
  
    return cities.slice(0, 3);

  }
  var inputCities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];
  nonMutatingSplice(inputCities);

/*Concatenation means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way. 
For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to concat, which is added to the end of the first array. 
It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays. Here's an example:

[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]);

The returned array would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. */

//Use the concat method in the nonMutatingConcat function to concatenate attach to the end of original. The function should return the concatenated array.

function nonMutatingConcat(original, attach) {
    return original.concat(attach);
  }
  var first = [1, 2, 3];
  var second = [4, 5];
  nonMutatingConcat(first, second);

/*Functional programming is all about creating and using non-mutating functions.
The last challenge introduced the concat method as a way to combine arrays into a new one without mutating the original arrays. 
Compare concat to the push method. push adds an item to the end of the same array it is called on, which mutates that array. Here's an example:

var arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push([4, 5, 6]);

arr would have a modified value of [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6]], which is not the functional programming way.
concat offers a way to add new items to the end of an array without any mutating side effects. */

//Change the nonMutatingPush function so it uses concat to add newItem to the end of original instead of push. The function should return an array.

function nonMutatingPush(original, newItem) {
    return original.concat(newItem);
  }
  var first = [1, 2, 3];
  var second = [4, 5];
  nonMutatingPush(first, second);
