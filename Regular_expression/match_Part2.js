/*Prior challenges showed that regular expressions can be used to look for a number of matches. 
They are also used to search for patterns in specific positions in strings.

In an earlier challenge, you used the caret character (^) inside a character set to create a negated character set in the form [^thingsThatWillNotBeMatched]. 
Outside of a character set, the caret is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings.

let firstString = "Ricky is first and can be found.";
let firstRegex = /^Ricky/;
firstRegex.test(firstString);
// Returns true
let notFirst = "You can't find Ricky now.";
firstRegex.test(notFirst);
// Returns false
*/

//Use the caret character in a regex to find "Cal" only in the beginning of the string rickyAndCal.

let rickyAndCal = "Cal and Ricky both like racing.";
let calRegex = /^Cal/; 
let result = calRegex.test(rickyAndCal);

/* In the last challenge, you learned to use the caret character to search for patterns at the beginning of strings. 
There is also a way to search for patterns at the end of strings.

You can search the end of strings using the dollar sign character $ at the end of the regex.

let theEnding = "This is a never ending story";
let storyRegex = /story$/;
storyRegex.test(theEnding);
// Returns true
let noEnding = "Sometimes a story will have to end";
storyRegex.test(noEnding);
// Returns false
*/

//Use the anchor character ($) to match the string "caboose" at the end of the string caboose.

let caboose = "The last car on a train is the caboose";
let lastRegex = /caboose$/; 
let result = lastRegex.test(caboose);

/* Using character classes, you were able to search for all letters of the alphabet with [a-z]. 
This kind of character class is common enough that there is a shortcut for it, although it includes a few extra characters as well.

The closest character class in JavaScript to match the alphabet is \w. This shortcut is equal to [A-Za-z0-9_]. This character class matches upper and lowercase letters plus numbers. 
Note, this character class also includes the underscore character (_).

let longHand = /[A-Za-z0-9_]+/;
let shortHand = /\w+/;
let numbers = "42";
let varNames = "important_var";
longHand.test(numbers); // Returns true
shortHand.test(numbers); // Returns true
longHand.test(varNames); // Returns true
shortHand.test(varNames); // Returns true

These shortcut character classes are also known as shorthand character classes.
*/

//Use the shorthand character class \w to count the number of alphanumeric characters in various quotes and strings.

let quoteSample = "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.";
let alphabetRegexV2 = /\w/g; 
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegexV2).length;

/*You've learned that you can use a shortcut to match alphanumerics [A-Za-z0-9_] using \w. 
A natural pattern you might want to search for is the opposite of alphanumerics.

You can search for the opposite of the \w with \W. Note, the opposite pattern uses a capital letter. 
This shortcut is the same as [^A-Za-z0-9_].

let shortHand = /\W/;
let numbers = "42%";
let sentence = "Coding!";
numbers.match(shortHand); // Returns ["%"]
sentence.match(shortHand); // Returns ["!"]

*/

//Use the shorthand character class \W to count the number of non-alphanumeric characters in various quotes and strings.

let quoteSample = "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.";
let nonAlphabetRegex = /\W/g; 
let result = quoteSample.match(nonAlphabetRegex).length;
